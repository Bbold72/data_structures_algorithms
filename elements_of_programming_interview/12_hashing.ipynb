    "# Hashing  \n",
    "A hash table is a data structure used to store keys, optionally, with corresponding values. Inserts, deletes, and lookups run in $O(1)$ time on average.    \n",
    "   \n",
    "The underlying idea is to store keys in an array. A key is stored in the array locations (\"slots\") based on its \"hash code\". The hash code is an integer computed from the key by a hash function. If the hash function is chosen well, the objects are distributed uniformly across array locations.    \n",
    "   \n",
    "If two keys map to the same location, a \"collision\" has occurred. the standard mechansim to deal with collisions is to maintain a linked list of objects at each array location. If the hash function does a good job of spreading objects across the underlying array and takes $O(1)$ time to compute, on average, lokkups, insertions, and deletions have $O(1 + n/m)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the number of objects and $m$ is the length of the array.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "If the \"load\" $n/m$ grows large, rehashing can be applied, but is expensive $O(n + m)$    \n"

    "## Tips\n",
    "- Hash tables have the **best theoretical and real-world performance** for lookup, insert and delete. Each of these operations has $O(1)$ time complexity. The $O(1)$ time complexity for insertions is for the average case - a single insert can take $O(n)$ if the hash table has to be resized.  \n",
    "- Consider using a hash code as a **signature** to enhance performance, e.g., to filter out candidates.  \n",
    "- Consider using a precomputed lookup table instead of boilerplate if-then code for mappings, e.g., from character to value or character to character.\n",
    "- When defining your own type that will be put in a hash table, be sure you understand the relationship between **logical equality** and the fields the hash function must inspect. Specifically, anytime equality is implemented, it is imperative that the correct hash function is also implemented, o/w when objects are placed in hash tables, logically equivalent objects may appear in different buckets, leading to lookups returning false, even when the searched item is present.\n",
    "- Somtimes you'll need a **multimap**, i.e., a map that contains multiple values for a single key, or a bi-directional map. "
